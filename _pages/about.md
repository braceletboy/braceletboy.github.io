# About Me
## Introduction
Hi, I am Rukmangadh Sai Myana. People call me 'Rukman'. I am currently a PhD student at the [Knight Foundation School of Computer and Information Sciences][1] in [Florida International University][2]. I primarily focus my research on the Representation Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I like to look at Articial Intelligence from a wholistic perspective - read more about it [here][3]. I love data and data analysis. I believe that data driven solutions are the center of not just busniesses but also society in general. This blog of mine is an attempt to showcase this in a fun and educational way.
